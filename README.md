Glace is a multipurpose language transpiled to Rust. It takes from functional languages and tries to have a straightforward approach to logic in general.

> a proper README.md is on its way :), in the meantime, go look at [my website](https://maxime.gq/My-Languages/2021/03/glace-docs/)

## Installation

All you need is this repo around, and a proper Rust kit.

## Usage

Using the glacers.sh tool, you'll generate a readable Rust code file, and compile it at the same time. That lets you debug your code using the great Rust error system.

For the Rust tool:
```bash
./glacers.sh -s my_code.gl -o output.rs
```

## Description
As said earlier, Glace is a general purpose language, and it aims to stay simple.
