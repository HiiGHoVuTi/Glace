Glace is a multipurpose language transpiled to Rust. It takes from functional languages and tries to have a straightforward approach to logic in general.

> a proper README.md is on its way :)

## Installation

All you need is this repo around, and a proper Rust kit.

## Usage

Using the glace.sh tool, you'll generate a readable Rust code file, and compile it at the same time. That lets you debug your code using the great Rust error system.

```bash
./glace.sh -s my_code.gl -o output.rs
```
